# Portfolio Blog

A simple **portfolio blog webpage** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It features a clean, minimal design with sections for *About, Projects, Related Links, Experience,* and *Contact*.  

## Overview
- Pure HTML + CSS, no frameworks.  
- Includes text, images, video, audio, and Google Maps embed.  
- Responsive and lightweight.  
- Collapsible **navigation bar** created using the CSS `:target` selector.  

⚠️ **Note on Navigation**  
When the nav bar is open on mobile, use your device’s **back button** to close it (since it relies on the `:target` selector instead of JavaScript).
